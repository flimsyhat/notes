A Minimum Enjoyable Action, or MEA, is a behavior that is simple, small, and enjoyable – just enough to get started. More complex habits can be built by developing and combining MEAs.

(This is related to the concept of a minimum viable product in business.)

Track how often you successfylly perform an MEA. If you find it hard to follow an MEA, find ways to make it simpler. (Example: Journaling each night -> Writing one sentence each night -> Laying out pen and notebook each night)

This is a way to create self-sustaining motivation [[20181012163341]].
